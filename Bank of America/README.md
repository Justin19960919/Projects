This is an automated script to get all the money spent in different accounts in a certain timeframe 
to your computer and let you know how much you spent, while grouping by Payee.

Using python selenium to automate.

I will categorzie the transactions further by labeling, and maybe crontab to automatically
send me a report by email every end of the month.
